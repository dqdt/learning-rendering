Following along with: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/

For some reason, when I clone the repo and open it in Unity, it geneates a new .csproj with a bunch of includes like `<ProjectReference Include="Unity.Timeline.Editor.csproj">` and Omnisharp can't find these referenced files so it complains. The original .csproj DOES NOT HAVE THESE INCLUDES!! ???
